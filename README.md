Overview
This is a simple Currency Converter project developed in Java using JFrame for the user interface, and built within Eclipse IDE. The goal of this project is to help users easily convert between different currencies, eliminating the need to visit multiple websites for exchange rates. It provides an intuitive graphical interface where users can enter the amount, select the currencies, and instantly get the converted value.

Motivation
I created this project as part of my journey to improve my coding skills in Java. Every day, my mother faced the challenge of needing to send money back home, and she would have to visit multiple websites to check exchange rates. This process was tedious and time-consuming. To make her life easier, I decided to build a simple currency converter that would handle the task quickly and in one place.

This project allowed me to:

Practice core Java concepts such as functions, data structures, and exception handling.
Gain experience with JFrame, a part of Java's Swing library, to create graphical user interfaces.
Work in a professional development environment using Eclipse IDE.
Features
Simple and User-Friendly Interface: Easy to navigate with a graphical interface built using JFrame.
Quick Conversion: Converts between multiple currencies with predefined exchange rates.
Customizable: The code can be extended with additional currencies and real-time exchange rate retrieval via APIs.
Technologies Used
Java: The main programming language for the project.
JFrame: To build the graphical user interface (GUI).
Eclipse IDE: The development environment used to write and debug the code.
